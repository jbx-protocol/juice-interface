They can change token issuance rates, redemption rates, payouts, and other rules over time, leading to powerful and elegant tokenomics. They can also lock their project's rules in place for pre-determined amounts of time (called <6>cycles</6>), guaranteeing that they can't rugpull the community. Juicebox lets projects take control if they need to, but it also lets them give up control to build trust.</5><7>Importantly, Juicebox's crypto fundraising platform is on-chain and non-custodial.
