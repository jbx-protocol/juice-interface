              SharkDAO is a sub-DAO of Nouns DAO raising funds to participate in
              the Nouns ecosystem. Nouns is an on-chain generative NFT project
              with a daily auction of a 32x32 pixel character with heads that
              represent a noun like “moose,” “pylon,” or “banana.” SharkDAO
              brings together Nouns enthusiasts priced out of buying their own
              Noun with the shared goal of acquiring Nouns and contributing to
              the Nouns ecosystem. Since their launch in August 2021 SharkDAO
              has acquired 6 Nouns, put forward several successful proposals in
              Nouns DAO governance, and brought together over 900 nounish DAO
              members.

              With highly competitive auctions happening every 24 hours,
              SharkDAO's success was made possible through the flexibility of
              their Juicebox project settings. From cycle to cycle, SharkDAO
              enabled or disabled payments and adjusted $SHARK tokenomics (total
              issuance rate, reserved rate, and issuance reduction rate). With
              unlocked cycles and no edit deadline, they were able to make
              changes to their project quickly in response to upcoming Nouns
              auctions.

                Through community ownership and pooling resources, SharkDAO
                offered a way for members to participate in the Nouns ecosystem
                despite the high barrier to entry. SharkDAO members can own as
                little as one $SHARK token and become an active voice in Nouns
                DAO governance through the sub-DAO. To learn more about the
                story of SharkDAO, listen to Dropnerd on episode 5 of the
