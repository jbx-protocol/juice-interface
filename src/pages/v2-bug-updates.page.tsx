        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <h4>(Done) Disable project creation + V2 payments</h4>
        <p>
          To make project migration easier, creating projects on juicebox.money
          will be temporarily disabled along with payments to existing V2
          projects with a 0 treasury balance.
        </p>
        <h4>(Done) Redeploy Juicebox V2 protocol contracts</h4>
        <p>
          Redeployed contracts will include a fix, but will otherwise be
          functionally identical to the current protocol contracts.
        </p>
        <h4>(Done) Update juicebox.money app to use new contracts</h4>
        <p>
          Once the contracts have been redeployed, the app will be updated to
          use these contracts, and to provide an interface for existing V2
          projects to reconfigure their funding cycles with the new contracts.
        </p>
        <h4>(Done) Enabling new projects and project migration.</h4>
        <p>
          To re-enable project creation, the JuiceboxDAO multisig members must
          migrate the JuiceboxDAO project (https://juicebox.money/
          {v2v3ProjectRoute({ projectId: 1 })}) as soon as possible, so that it
          can start accepting fees from new projects.
        </p>
        <h4>(In progress) Project migration.</h4>
        <p>
          JuiceboxDAO and Peel will support existing V2 projects to reconfigure
          on the new V2 contracts as needed, and ensure all token balances are
          migrated.
