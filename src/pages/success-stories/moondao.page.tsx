              MoonDAO is a worldwide collective united by the mission of
              decentralizing access to space research and exploration. With
              privatized space exploration on the rise, MoonDAO is uniting space
              enthusiasts from around the globe to help make it more accessible
              while continuing to push research forward. In 2021, they launched
              a campaign to buy two tickets on a Blue Origin rocket and raised
              over $8 million on Juicebox. A year later, they sent Coby Cotton
              from viral YouTube channel Dude Perfect to space as their first
              astronaut.

              Following the launch of their token $MOONEY, the next goal on
              MoonDAO's roadmap was to buy two tickets to space on a Blue Origin
              rocket. They set the project's Payouts to Infinite in order to
              raise as much as possible during their campaign and be able to
              distribute all of the funds. Using a reserved rate of 50%, the
              MoonDAO multi-sig received half of all newly minted tokens to
              build up a treasury of both ETH and $MOONEY that could later be
              used for bounties and compensation.

                MoonDAO has built an enthusiastic community of over 10,000
                members, successfully sent their first astronaut to space, and
                is currently coordinating the spaceflight for their second
                astronaut. Their ambitious long-term roadmap goals include
                building a settlement on the Moon by 2030. In collaboration with
                StudioDAO, a decentralized movie studio running on Juicebox,
                MoonDAO has donated $100,000 to help fund the production of
                Ticket To Space, the first DAO documentary. The film will cover
                the story of Yan, a MoonDAO member from China, who will be sent
                to space on an upcoming Blue Origin flight after minting a free
                NFT.

                Bringing together members from around the world with the help of
                blockchain technology and decentralized governance, MoonDAO has
                demonstrated that sometimes setting ambitious and even
                outlandish goals can pay off when they resonate with your
                audience. Their unique mission goes beyond memes, though, and
                taps into a deeper human curiosity about what might exist beyond
                planet Earth. To learn more about the story of MoonDAO, listen
