          <p>
            This website interacts with the Ethereum blockchain â€” to use it,
            you'll need to have a wallet and some ETH (ETH is the main currency
            on Ethereum). You can get a free wallet from{' '}
            <ExternalLink href="https://metamask.io">MetaMask.io</ExternalLink>,
            and buy ETH from within the wallet by using a credit card.

          <p>
            Juicebox is a programmable funding platform for crypto and web3. It
            helps people fund, operate, and scale their projects transparently
            using Ethereum, which is a type of programmable cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <p>Juicebox is funded and owned by its community.</p>

    {
      q: <Trans>What happens when I pay a project?</Trans>,
      a: (
        <Trans>
          <p>
            When you pay a project, you <i>may</i> receive that project's tokens
            or NFTs (depending on how the project is set up).
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, these tokens represent a partial claim on funds in the
            treasury, and they are often used for governance rights, community
            access, or other membership perks.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this can change from project to project. Read everything
            carefully, and make sure you understand the project's configurations
            before you support it. If you need help, stop by the{' '}
            <JBDiscordLink>Juicebox Discord server</JBDiscordLink>.

      q: <Trans>What does Juicebox actually do?</Trans>,
      a: (
        <Trans>
          <p>To summarize:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              When people pay a project, they receive the project's tokens. Like
              other tokens, these can be used for governance, for token-gated
              websites, and other purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Projects can distribute funds to the wallets or Juicebox projects
              of their choosing. These distributions can be pre-defined, and
              they can also be changed over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              If people are unhappy with the direction a project is headed, they
              can redeem their tokens to claim a share of the ETH held in the
              project.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Project creators have powerful controls over each one of these
            mechanics. They can change token issuance rates, redemption rates,
            distributions, and other project settings over time, leading to
            powerful and elegant tokenomics. They can also lock the project's
            settings in place for pre-determined amounts of time, guaranteeing
            that they can't rugpull the community. Juicebox lets projects take
            control if they need to, but it also lets them give up control to
            build trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Importantly, Juicebox is on-chain and non-custodial. Project
            creators actually own their projects, and JuiceboxDAO has no access
            to their funds or their project's settings.

      q: <Trans>How decentralized is Juicebox?</Trans>,
      a: (
        <Trans>
          <p>
            Juicebox is a governance-minimal protocol. There are only a few
            levers that can be tuned, none of which impose changes for users
            without their consent. The Juicebox governance smart contract can
            adjust these levers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Juicebox protocol is governed by a community of JBX token
            holders who vote on proposals fortnightly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Juicebox is on-chain and non-custodial. Project creators actually
            own their projects, and JuiceboxDAO has no access to their funds or
            their project's settings.

              multiple security audits
            </ExternalLink>
            , and has handled tens of thousands of ETH through its protocol. So
            far, Juicebox has had 0 security mishaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Juicebox is still experimental software. Although the
            Juicebox contract team have done their part to shape the smart
            contracts for public use and have tested the code thoroughly, the
            risk of exploits is never 0%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to their public nature, any exploits to the contracts may have
            irreversible consequences, including loss of funds. Please use
            Juicebox with caution.
