            Juicebox is a programmable crypto fundraising platform for web3. It
            helps people fund, operate, and scale their projects transparently
            using Ethereum, which is a type of programmable cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <p>Juicebox is funded and owned by its community.</p>

      a: (
        <Trans>
          <p>
            When you pay a project, you <i>may</i> receive that project's tokens
            or NFTs (depending on how the project is set up).
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, these tokens represent a partial claim on the project's
            ETH, and they are often used for governance rights, community
            access, or other membership perks.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this can change from project to project. Read everything
            carefully, and make sure you understand the project's rules before
            you support it. If you need help,{' '}
            <Link href="/contact">contact us</Link>, or stop by the{' '}

          <p>To summarize:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-10">
            <li>
              When people pay a project, they receive the project's tokens. Like
              other tokens, these can be used for governance, for token-gated
              websites, and other purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Projects can pay out ETH to the wallets or Juicebox projects of
              their choosing. These payouts can be pre-defined, and they can
              also be changed over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              If people are unhappy with the direction a project is headed, they
              can redeem their tokens to claim a share of the ETH held in the
              project.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Project creators have powerful controls over each one of these
            mechanics. They can change token issuance rates, redemption rates,
            payouts, and other rules over time, leading to powerful and elegant
            tokenomics. They can also lock their project's rules in place for
            pre-determined amounts of time (called <i>cycles</i>), guaranteeing
            that they can't rugpull the community. Juicebox lets projects take
            control if they need to, but it also lets them give up control to
            build trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Importantly, Juicebox's crypto fundraising platform is on-chain and
            non-custodial. Project creators actually own their projects, and
            JuiceboxDAO has no way to access a project's ETH or change its
            rules.

            However, Juicebox is still experimental software. Although the
            Juicebox contract team have done their part to shape the smart

            risk of exploits is never 0%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to their public nature, any exploits to the contracts may have
            irreversible consequences, including loss of ETH. Please use
