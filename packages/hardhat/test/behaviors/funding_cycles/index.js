/** 
  These tests rely on time manipulation quite a bit, which as far as i understand is hard to do precisely. 
  Ideally, the tests could mock the block.timestamp to preset numbers, but instead 
  they rely on 'fastforwarding' the time between operations. Fastforwarding creates a
  high probability that the subsequent operation will fall on a block with the intended timestamp,
  but there's a small chance that there's an off-by-one error. 

  If anyone has ideas on how to mitigate this, please let me know.
