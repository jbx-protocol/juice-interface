    q: 'Who funds Juice projects?',
    a: [
      `Users fund your project by paying to use your app or service, or as a patron or investor by making a payment directly to your project's smart contract (like on this site).`,
      `For users paying through your app, you should route those funds through the Juice smart contracts so they receive Tokens in return.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: `What does Juice cost?`,
    a: [
      `Juice is an open protocol on Ethereum that makes money using Juice itself. You can check out the contractualized budget specs at ${window.location.href}juice.`,
      `5% of all money made by projects using Juice is sent to help pay for Juice itself. In exchange, projects get tokens, which will be worth more as the ecosystem grows over time.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: `What is overflow`,
    a: [
      `If you know how much your project needs to earn over some period of time to be sustainable, you can set a funding target with that amount. If your project earns more than that, the surplus funds are locked in an overflow pool. Overflow funds earn interest, and may be claimed by your community token holders by burning their tokens.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: 'What are community tokens?',
    a: [
      `Each project has its own tokens which can either be staked or withdrawn as ERC-20s. Everyone who funds a project gets a newly minted supply of tokens in return. `,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: `Why should I want to own a project's tokens?`,
    a: [
      `Tokens can be redeemed for a portion of a project's overflow, letting you benefit from the project's success. After all, you helped it get there!`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: `What's a discount rate?`,
    a: [
      `Juice projects can be created with an optional discount rate to incentivize funding the project earlier than later. With each new funding cycle, the discount rate decreases the number of tokens that are printed per payment.`,
      `For example: with a discount rate of 97%, $100 paid to a project today might mint you 100 tokens, but the same amount paid during the next funding cycle would only mint you 97.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: `What's a bonding curve?`,
    a: [
      `A bonding curve rewards people who wait longer to redeem your tokens for overflow.`,
      `For example: with a bonding curve of 70%, redeeming 10% of the token supply at any given time will claim around 7% of the total overflow.`,
      `The rest is left to share between token hodlers.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a project benefit from its own overflow?',
    a: [
      `A project can choose to reserve a percentage of tokens for itself. Instead of being distributed to paying users, this percentage of tokens is instead printed for the project.`,
      `Holding these tokens entitles a project to a portion of its own overflow.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Can I change my project's contract after it's been created?",
    a: [
      `A project owner can propose changes to any part of the contract at any time, with changes taking effect after the current budgeting time frame has ended.`,
      `For now, a minimum of 14 days must pass from the time of a proposed reconfiguration for it to take effect. This gives token holders time to react to the decision.`,
      `Anyone can deploy and use another governance smart contract to override this scheme.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: 'Why Ethereum?',
    a: [
      `A mechanism like Juice where upfront financial commitments should be honored over time is only guarenteed within an ecosystem like Ethereum.`,
      `Ethereum provides a public environment where internet apps like Juice can run permissionlessly, trustlessly, and unstoppably.`,
      `This means that anyone can see the code that they're using, anyone can use the code without asking for permission, and no one can mess with the code or take it down.`,
      `People using Juice are interacting with each other through public infrastructureâ€”not a private, profit-seeking corporate service that brokers the exchange.`,
      `Juice was built to allow people and projects to get paid for creating public art and infrastructure, as much as or more than they would working towards corporate ends. No more shady business.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: 'How decentralized is Juice?',
    a: [
      `Juice is a governance-minimal protocol, meaning there are only a few levers that can be tuned, none of which impose changes for users without their consent. The Juice governance smart contract can adjust these levers.`,
      `At the start, power over the governance smart contract is held by Juice's founding contributors. The intent is to soon transfer the power to a community of token holders.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the risks?',
    a: [
      `Juice is experimental software. Although the founding contributors have done their part to shape the smart contracts for public use, there still may be bugs.`,
      `Due to their public nature, any exploits to the contracts may have irreversable consequences, including loss of funds. Please use Juice with caution.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: 'Will it work on L2s?',
    a: [
      `Yes, but the core Juice contracts will first be deployed to Ethereum Mainnet.`,
      `The founding contributors will then be working on L2 payment terminals for Juice projects.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    q: `Do I have to make my project open source in order to use Juice as its business model?`,
