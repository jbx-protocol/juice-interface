        <p>
          Your contract will use these ERC-20 tokens like tickets, handing them
          out to people as a receipt for payments received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tickets can be redeemed for your contract's overflow on a bonding
          curve â€“ a ticket is redeemable for 38.2% of its proportional
          overflowed tokens. Meaning, if there are 100 overflow tokens available
          and 100 of your tickets in circulation, 10 tickets could be redeemed
          for 3.82 of the overflow tokens. The rest is left to share between the
          remaining ticket hodlers, incentivizing commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can propose reconfigurations to your contract's specs at any time.
          Your ticket holders will have 7 days to vote yay or nay. If there are
          33% more yays than nays (a supermajority), the new specs will be used
          once the active budgeting time frame expires.
