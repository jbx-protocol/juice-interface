These payouts can be pre-defined, and they can also be changed over time.</3><4>If people are unhappy with the direction a project is headed, they can redeem their tokens to claim a share of the ETH held in the project.</4></1><5>Project creators have powerful controls over each one of these mechanics. They can change token issuance rates, redemption rates, payouts, and other rules over time, leading to powerful and elegant tokenomics. They can also lock their project's rules in place for pre-determined amounts of time (called <6>cycles</6>), guaranteeing that they can't rugpull the community. Juicebox lets projects take control if they need to, but it also lets them give up control to build trust.</5><7>Importantly, Juicebox's crypto fundraising platform is on-chain and non-custodial.
