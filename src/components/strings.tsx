export const ISSUE_ERC20_EXPLANATION = (
  <Trans>
    Create an ERC-20, and allow your supporters to claim your project's tokens
    as that ERC-20. This makes your tokens compatible with tools like Uniswap.
  </Trans>
)

export const PROJECT_PAYER_ADDRESS_EXPLANATION = (
  <Trans>
    Deploy an address which forwards ETH to your project. This makes it easier
    to pay your project with third-party tools.

  <Trans>
    Deploy an address which forwards ETH directly to your project's payouts.

  <Trans>
    <p>With unlocked cycles, you can edit your project's rules at any time.</p>
    <p>
      With locked cycles, you can lock your project's rules for a period of time
      (like 3 minutes, 2 years, or 14 days), helping you build trust with your
      supporters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This choice isn't permanent — you can switch between locked and unlocked
      cycles in the future.
    </p>

    If locked, this payout can't be edited or removed until the lock expires or
    the cycle is edited.

export const DISTRIBUTION_LIMIT_EXPLANATION = (
  <Trans>
    The amount of ETH which can be paid out from this project during the cycle.
    Payouts reset each cycle.

export const DISCOUNT_RATE_EXPLANATION = (
  <Trans>
    The issuance rate is reduced by this amount each cycle (unless the owner
    changes the issuance rate).
  </Trans>
)

export const REDEMPTION_RATE_EXPLANATION = (
  <Trans>
    <p>
      Supporters can burn their tokens to reclaim some of the ETH not needed for
      payouts. The amount of ETH they receive depends on the redemption rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 100%, redemptions are 1:1 — somebody redeeming 10% of all project
      tokens will receive 10% of the available ETH. At 0%, redemptions are
      turned off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anywhere else, redemptions take place along a bonding curve, meaning
      people who redeem first will get less ETH per token, and people who redeem
      later will get more ETH per token.

    <p>
      Edits to this project must be made before this deadline. This gives token
      holders time to verify the edits before they take effect.

      For example: with a 1-day edit deadline, edits must be made at least 1 day
      before a cycle starts.
