              <strong>Recurring cycles</strong>. Among other things, this allows
              you to predictably pay out ETH on weekly basis, or some other
              regular cadence.

              predictably reduce your project token's issuance rate (tokens per
              ETH) over time without needing to manually edit your cycle.
