Product Roadmap

- Build L2 Juicebox terminals so projects can get paid on L2s. 
- Design FundingCycleBallots so that projects can choose to hand off reconfiguration decisions to their ticket holders, etc.
- Build mods for all kinds of things. 
- Transfer control of governance from the founding contributors to JUICE ticket holders.
